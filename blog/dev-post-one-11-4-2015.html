						<h2>Post #1</h2>
						<font size="4">8/24/2015 - 11/4/2015</font> 
					</header>
					<p>Hello! This is my first post on my new website. This will eventually house a variety of posts about my experiences, points of views and projects.
					</p>
					<p><h3>HELLO WORLD:</h3></p><p>
First off I would like to say that I am currently only one person. I have nothing against working with a team, in fact I strongly encourage it, but I'll get to that later. D2D Industries is a representation of the vision I have for what could one day become of my ideas. If I had to sum up the current short-term vision of D2D Industries it would be along the lines of "To Showcase Art, Inspiration and Expression". This is the start of something that I hope will some day have meaning. Here are some of my goals right now. I want to find and talk to those who have ideas and no guidance to act on those ideas. I want to discover enough on my own so that I could assist others who also find all of this interesting. I want to continue to research and develop my skillset and I want to create and produce a notable work. It's difficult for me to judge the audience for what I'm writing, but I'll try my best to write for all. There are numerous people who are far more experienced and successful than I am however there are also many who are less. The same thing goes for you! You may not realize it, but there are things that you know that your grandma thinks is rocket science. Listen, I'll give it my best shot. Maybe this website will float away down the mystical river of websites that you will never read again, or maybe you'll stick around for a while and learn (or teach me!) a thing or two.</p>
					<p><h3>THE LABELED INVENTOR:</h3></p><p>
If you've explored the main page you probably noticed a small collection of applications that I have developed or that I'm in the process of developing. Currently there are two works that I'm most invested in and others that I've completed but care very little for. Perfect example would be Tappy Cube which was created in an hour when I saw the success of Flappy Bird and said to myself.. I could do that. Honestly a majority of my game development time is spent on thinking or creating sprites/images. This is a part of the reason why I strongly recommend forming a team but again, I'll get to that later. Unfortunately being one of the few apps that I've ever released, people I know have judged me solely based on this very not serious creation. Hey, listen, it's not totally hopeless. It just needs a major update. I mean everyone I know was very supportive of such a simple and obviously terrible game. Even people I barely knew acted like they were meeting the next Bill Gates when they saw me working on it, or noticed it on someones phone. You see there is no perfect formula for the best game, or the best app. You can create a game or app of anything and it could become huge for no reason. The world is spontaneous and unpredictable and this can be helpful for people like us. I may be labeled for Tappy Cube, but I know that my other works such as Knights World (check out www.knightsworld.rocks for info about my work-in-progress) are a much better representation of the time and effort that I put into what I create.</p>
					<p><h3>VISION:</h3></p><p>
It's really hard to measure the potential of a creation. Flappy Bird is one of thousands and thousands of examples of apps that I could easily have thought of or created myself. I'm not being big headed, I swear! Open up your phone and go to any market place, scroll through for a while and I guarentee you'll find atleast one application that you could've created. You have to know that people want to help you out. You may think that you're alone or that the vision you have for an app is silly to others but it's not. Many people want to and enjoy helping others. It gives them a feeling of fulfillment. I mean hey, if all I had to do was download a silly game to make someone's life just a little better than sure I'd do it! This helps more than you may realize. A simple observation will tell you that establishing a large user base is a crucial part of being successful. Your friends and family will be critical for those who are completely starting from scratch or as I am going to call it, Phase Zero. There are an enourmous amount of steps in Phase Zero for those that are just starting but If you enjoy this, than you can absolutely do this. I can't stress that enough, if this is not something you really enjoy doing, you're probably going to feel like a huge failure. I mean for me personally there are times when I drive myself crazy thinking of ideas, or understanding new concepts whether in design, programming or marketing. I'm currently a one man team, and I'm aware of the limitations that this imposes. My hope is that I can help others manage their limited time and abilities to atleast get to the point that I am at. A variety of projects, ideas and plans. There are countless ideas that still haven't been touched. With the market constistently cycling as users get bored with whatever top apps currently hold top rank, positions open up for the possibility of small time groups or developers to take their place. Why can't it be us?</p>
					<p><h3>GAMEPLAN:</h3></p><p>
I may just be getting started but I think I am decently far in the process and I have absolutely learned a lot over the years. Let's say I'm in Phase Two of the Gameplan. For those who are entirely new at this, I plan on creating an explanation of earlier stages in development. For now I suggest starting a list of ideas that you would enjoy creating.</p>
<p>So what's some of the things that makes up what I call Phase Two?</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Well I recently created a website to act as a trophy case for what I've created.</li>
<li>I'm currently working on starting and establishing a social network presence.</li>
<li>I'm polishing works in order to keep progressing.</li>
<li>I've read countless articles and perspectives of other developers.</li>
<li>I have a developed Plan for continued expansion of my presence and success.</li>
<li>I maintain an expanding list of ideas that seem promising.</li></ul>
					<p><h3>CROSS-PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT:</h3></p><p>
Over the years I have begun research into various cross-platform application development methods. I came to the realization that I wanted to be a part of the web/game/app/design development community. Let me tell you a little about my work to start off. In short I have spent hours upon hours, nights after nights, years after years researching and programming various applications that sprouted from ideas that I constantly stumbled upon and I have very little to show for it. All of this started with a simple list. One day I began writing down every single idea that popped into my head no matter how dumb or how brilliant I thought of it at the time. Now I have an enourmous list. Anytime I need some inspiration, all I have to do is open up my list and look around. I strongly encourage creating your own list of ideas. You wouldn't believe how many ideas just float away when you don't write them down. My personal goal was to create applications that can be used on all platforms. Growing up I always hated the console wars, or the operating system wars. The world is an on-going battle of the brands. I personally believe in cross-platform compatibility. If I have an android device, I should be able to tell my friend who has an iPhone to download the app too. If I'm playing a game or using an app on one device, I should be able to use it on another. I believe that exclusivity limits technology capabilities. If you agree with me, I suggest looking into the tools I listed on my main page.</p>
					<p><h3>CROSS-PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:</h3></p><p>
Both Phonegap and Gamemaker Studio provide relatively efficient ways at exporting an application to multiple platforms. Gamemaker Studio costs a good chunk of cash but it's an excellent tool for game development. The GM community is one of the best I've been able to find and they really help you to dive into what ever game idea you can think of creating. Phonegap on the other hand allows you to create cross-platorm applications in HTML5, CSS and Javascript and it does so for free! I always found HTML interesting to work with so I used this tool quite a lot in various competitions. Ping and Ignite were both created using Phonegap so that I was able to display the application on a tablet, a laptop, an Android and an iPhone device at the same time when demonstrating.</p>
					<p><h3>MOTIVATION</h3></p><p>
I may not have a success story to share, or a particular product that hit it big, but I do know that the hours I've spent working on side projects weren't for nothing. This stuff takes time. Working out any problem takes time. Thinking of ideas, creating visual graphics, sprites, layout design, marketing, testing, debugging etc.. It all takes time. However, the best thing that comes out of working on these projects isn't always it's success. I mean yeah of course it would be great to create the next Snapchat or Facebook, but that's not all this is about. I mean look at the facts. Assuming that you're an independent developer such as myself, you're drasticaly limited in how much time you can put into the numerous steps that go into creating a project. You can always find graphic resources online, have someone market your product for you, but I always felt that doing this kind of takes away an ideas complete originality. I like to create something that I think of and know that I created every single line of code, and every single graphic displayed inside that application. Now on the flip side, it is completely alright to find resources other places. Like I said, time is your enemy here and anything to shorten the amount of time a project takes, the better. This is why working in teams is so important in the development industry since we are so limited as to what we can produce by ourselves.</p>
					<p><h3>SOCIAL:</h3></p><p>
Don't allow yourself to become that guy who hasn't seen the light of day in weeks and smells like the onion-eqsue tears of his failures. Even if it seems like you can develop applications without interacting with other people, I'm here to tell you that you can't. Well, you can, but in the end your ideas and projects are going to be used by actual living breathing people. (Random Side Note: Personal hygiene is very important and unfortunately I can't resist telling the developer world that they need to get up from that computer and stay healthy.) After you create something you're going to need friends to check out what you've done so you can find things you may not have noticed on your own. Friends are so important in this process because friends are the people who spread your idea. Friends can be anyone from a partner working on the project with you, to a friend of a friend who thought your idea was cool and tells other people about it. A friend can even be a business contact who knows others that are interested in the same work that you are. Friends are important and the ability to socialize is just as important as the ability to create the world's next big thing. Staying healthy, happy and social is very important to this whole process.</p>
					<p><h3>COMPUTER SCIENCE CAREER RANT:</h3></p><p>
I personally feel that many career paths do not emphasize the importance of being well-developed socially, especially in most Computer Science industries. Many interviewers hand you a marker and tell you to code 'this', and if you don't remember how to do 'this', it makes you look like you don't know what you're doing. I feel that the programming aspect of interviews is very important but I think memorizing specifics that can be found in less than a second with an internet search isn't a true test of how well you could do the job they're hiring for. Job interviews don't seem to stress creativity and out of the box thinking enough and this can really hurt company growth without them even realizing it.</p>
					<p><h3>TEAM WORK:</h3></p><p>
Finding a team has always been a goal of mine and I hope to elaborate on this topic soon.</p>
					<p><h3>In the next blog post I'm going to focus on my personal view of the market place in the eyes of a newborn developer such as myself. There are millions of apps floating around the various market places, heading for the abyss of the unnoticed. The app market can be divided into many subgroups of functionality.</h3></p>
					<p><h3>Preview- Warzone of The Greats</h3></p><p>
There exists the highest of the high, the richest of the rich, the top 100 applications on the market. I'm not talking about a specific market either, I'm talking about the general warzone of a market place that app development has been forced into. This top 100 is what makes things so difficult for the other million products on the market. I don't blame the top 100 apps, in fact I encourage everyone to shoot for the top in that manner. I'm only trying to put the challenge of app development into perspective. Take it from me, someone who has yet to even breach the surface of success, this isn't going to be easy but I absolutely encourage everyone to step up to the challenge.</p>		
					<p><h3>This Blog Post is still a work-in-progress! I have a lot of ideas and thoughts I want to convey but I want to keep my points in order. Hopefully I get time to expand on these points soon. I based this website off of an HTML5 template and modified it myself. If you liked it, please subscribe! I won't spam your email with newsletters but when I do post, you'll be the first to know! Thank you for reading.</h3></p>
